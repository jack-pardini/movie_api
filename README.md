# MyFlix: Server-Side Development

# Overview
This project focuses on building the backend for a movie-based web application, myFlix. It serves as a foundation for a full-stack JavaScript project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

# Project Goals
- Create a RESTful API to handle movie-related data.
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Design and implement a MongoDB database for data storage.
- Adhere to best practices for data security and validation.

# Key Features
- Movie Management: Retrieve movie lists, details, genres, and directors.
- User Management: Allow user registration, profile updates, and favorite movie management.
- Authentication: Implement secure user authentication and authorization.

# Technical Requirements
- Node.js and Express: Build the web server and API.
- MongoDB and Mongoose: Create and manage the database.
- RESTful API: Design and implement API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Authentication: Utilize HTTP and JWT-based authentication.
- Data Validation: Implement robust data validation mechanisms.
- Deployment: Deploy the API to Heroku and GitHub.

# Project Structure
The project follows a standard Node.js project structure with the following key directories and files:

- models: Contains Mongoose schemas for data modeling.
- routes: Defines API endpoints and request handlers.
- controllers: Handles business logic and data interactions.
- config: Stores configuration settings.
- tests: Includes test cases for API endpoints and models.
